In a world where so many of our interactions now take place online, it feels
strange that we build in so many features into messaging platforms that serve to
apply pressure or stress to one user just for the mild convenience of another. Read
receipts, typing notifications, online presence status all feel as if they fit under
this category. Worse, they are often enabled by default. Perhaps users do not even
realise that they can be controlled or switched off on some platforms. Other platforms
just don't provide such controls at all.

iMessage, for example, doesn't show online status but it does send read receipts by
default. You can even control this on a per-contact basis so that you can opt to
send or not to send read receipts to specific people, although it's not terribly obvious
to novice users how to do this (you have to open the contact card within the Messages
app specifically). Typing notifications are sent always - they can't be switched off
either on a per-contact basis or globally. There's just nothing you can do about that.

WhatsApp and Telegram both reveal online status by default, showing your contacts
when you have the app open. They also both send read receipts and typing by default.
In the case of WhatsApp, you can disable read receipts for individual one-to-one
messages but not for group chats. You seemingly can't disable typing notifications
on either.

Even the majority of Matrix clients, Element included, default to enabling these
features. The "Show read receipts sent by other users" option in Element, confusingly
named, doesn't even promise to stop read receipts being sent to other users, even
though such options are available for typing notifications. Third party clients all
have their own unique options and behaviours, none of them guaranteed to have sane
defaults either.

There are, arguably, some cases where these features may be useful or desirable.
I might feel comfortable with family or certain friends knowing that I have read a
message or that I am in the process of writing back to them. On the contrary, these
features are now effectively social cues and therefore come with all of the extra 
baggage that social cues bring. Why don't we expect more control over this?

A good friend or family member probably wouldn't misinterpret one of their messages
being left on read for a while. Someone who knows you well enough to know when you are
likely to be busy or that you will reply later will accept these markers much more
willingly. In these cases it is quite possible that you would feel comfortable enabling
these features with specific individuals.

In many other cases though, with acquaintances, colleagues or strangers, leaving a
message read for an extended period of time without responding to it may be considered
hostile or rude. Likewise with noticing that another user has been opening and closing
the app but still not acting on your message, or that they got half way through typing
a message before abandoning it.

Knowing these things places an unfair burden on us all. Is it better just to ignore a
push notification for a message and not open the app for as long as it can be avoided just to
avoid dealing with a certain person? You could avoid opening a specific chat, but what
if they still see that you are online? If I get interrupted midway through typing a message
and the other party sees the typing notification disappear, does that come across as
passive-aggressive? Will it prompt the other user to send even more messages asking why?
Is it easier to just succumb to the pressure, drop everything and respond now just to avoid
causing any offence or to prevent awkwardness?

This is a complete mental health minefield. Instant messaging was born out of a need for
convenience and yet this is a perfect example of how poorly designed convenience can
contribute to our stress.

Instead I propose that these user-hostile features should be disabled by default. Make
it easy for users to control when these markers are sent and only do so if the user has
specifically opted in. Don't send signals on my behalf otherwise. It will make for a much
healthier instant messaging experience, one with less pressure involved, fewer expectations
and less unintentional misunderstandings.
