Go is a programming language which passes by value, which effectively means that if you give a
value as a parameter to a function, the received value within the function is actually a *copy*
of the original. You can modify it however you wish and your changes will not affect the
original value or escape the function scope. This is in contrast to some languages which
pass values by reference instead of copying them.

Newcomers to Go, however, will quickly discover that it doesn't feel as though this is what
is really happening in practice. You pass a map into a function only to find that if that
function modifies the map, it gets modified everywhere. Worse, the program might just break
in mysterious ways or panic altogether! What gives?

Go already exposes references to the programmer in the form of pointers — that is, using
`*type` instead of `type` and then taking the reference of a variable using `&variable`.
In this case, passing a pointer into a function is still *passing by value* in the
strictest sense, but it's actually the pointer's value itself that is being copied, not the
thing that the pointer refers to. This makes it possible to deliberately allow multiple
functions, goroutines or sections of code to perform operations on the same variables.

To better understand what's going on with more complex types, it's important to know that
Go really has two classes of datatype: "value" types and "reference" types. Primitive types
are all "value" types — those include the usual `int`, `string`, `byte`, `rune`, `bool` types
and so on. Pointer types are "reference" types. However, maps, slices and channels are all
special types that *are or contain references*. The following sections explore at a high
level how these work.

### Slices

A slice is a flexible reference to an array and has three fields: a pointer
to the underlying memory, a "size" field which specifies how many elements of
the underlying array are referenced, and finally, a "capacity" field which specifies
the maximum size of the slice. The actual value contents of the slice are stored in the
underlying memory in a "backing array", and the slice itself serves as a reference to
this space.

As a result, copying a slice or passing it as a value doesn't actually copy the underlying
array or the data within - it merely copies the pointer, size and capacity. Manipulating the
boundaries of a slice is therefore extremely cheap as this only requires modifying the pointer
or size internally. It also means that you can have multiple slice references pointing to the
same underlying array in memory, even if those slices are of different sizes!

In this case, the thing being passed-by-value is the *slice reference*, not the contents of
the slice!

Note that the behaviour around `append` is influenced by the size and the capacity of the
slice. If an `append` can be satisfied without the size exceeding the capacity, the new
resulting slice returned by `append` will refer to the same underlying array. However, if the
`append` would result in the new slice exceeding the capacity of the original, the underlying
array is copied and the new resulting slice will refer to the copied array with a newly
expanded capacity value. Therefore it is not necessarily safe to assume whether the slice
returned by `append` will be a copy or not.

### Maps

A map reference is actually a pointer to a map header struct in memory (`type hmap` internally).
In the background, the Go compiler rewrites various map syntax to special functions within
the `runtime` package which take a pointer to this struct. The header contains various fields, including the number of cells, a hash seed, flags and pointers to the top-level hashmap
buckets.

As with slices, copying a map or passing it as a value doesn't actually copy the underlying hashmap
— it merely copies the pointer to the header struct. Therefore, copying a map reference is
just giving you multiple references to the same underlying map in memory.

Once again, it is the *map reference* that is being passed-by-value, not the contents of the
map.

### Channels

A channel reference is also a pointer to a channel header struct in memory (`type hchan`
internally), similar to maps, and the Go compiler rewrites some of the syntactic sugar
around channels to functions in the `runtime` package too. The header actually contains
a pointer to a buffer array in memory, along with various offsets and size fields, a
mutex and lists of active senders and receivers.

By now you'll be probably spotting the pattern — indeed copying the channel is just
copying the pointer to the header struct, so you're really just ending up with more
references to the same channel. Indeed this is necessary as you will want to be able to
pass these references around so that you can send to or receive from the channel elsewhere.

The *channel reference* is being passed-by-value, not the queued values in the channel.

Note that channel references can be casted into and passed as "directed" references — in
effect, your `chan type` can be converted into a send-only `chan<- type` or a receive-only
`<-chan type` by copying the reference but assigning it a directed type. In this case, the
same channel header is still used to access the channel internally and the direction-specific 
behaviour is actually enforced by the type system. The header itself is not copied.

### Structs

So at this point, you might be wondering about structs. Strictly speaking, structs
aren't primitive types, but they also aren't reference types in the same way that
slices, maps and channels are. They are "value" types, however, and therefore
passing a struct (rather than a pointer to a struct) means that the struct will be copied.
This also means that all value types within the struct are copied — for example, `string` or
`int` fields will have their values copied too. However, a struct can also contain slice, map
or channel references. What happens in this case?

The *references themselves* will be copied, but *only* the references! Therefore, passing a
struct as a value that contains a map, channel or slice (as opposed to passing a pointer
to the struct) is not enough to guarantee that the receiving function can't modify the
contents of the original struct beyond it's own scope — unless you specifically create
a copy of the map or slice, the receiver will be accessing and modifying the same underlying
memory. 

### Data races

When adding goroutines into the mix, things get especially complicated. Duplicating
references and passing them to different goroutines can result in data races unless the
correct synchronisation primitives (such as mutex locks) are used. Channels are the main
exception to this rule as they are thread-safe by nature and are often used as a
synchronisation primitive too.

Maps in Go are not safe for concurrent reads and writes. Trying to read a map in one
goroutine at the same time as writing to it from another goroutine will result in a panic,
therefore if you want to read *and* write a map from multiple goroutines currently, you
must synchronise these operations, e.g. using `sync.RWMutex`. This is because the map
header can be modified by a map write. (There's actually a special `sync.Map` type for
dealing with this problem, too!)

Slices behave differently again. Since each value of the underlying array has it's own
address in memory and are treated as distinct variables, reading one slice element while
writing another is typically safe, but reading and writing the same element from different
goroutines is absolutely not safe and will result in data races if those accesses are not
synchronised. 

Therefore it is very important to consider where slice, map or channel references are
being duplicated to and what synchronisation is in place to ensure that data races cannot
occur.

### Takeaways

Of course, Go is still really passing-by-value in the truest sense of the term even with 
more complex types, it's just that the references are being passed as values instead of the
contents. However, the actual resulting behaviour can feel unintuitive at first and can result
in difficult-to-trace errors and bugs within a program. Even built-in functions like `append`
have the potential to lead you astray if you make incorrect assumptions about whether or not
a copy will take place.

So, if you are in any doubt and need to guarantee that a true copy is passed, always *copy
the maps or slices yourself*. Be especially mindful that returning references allow a caller
or consumer to mutate the referenced item, even in libraries or across package boundaries!
