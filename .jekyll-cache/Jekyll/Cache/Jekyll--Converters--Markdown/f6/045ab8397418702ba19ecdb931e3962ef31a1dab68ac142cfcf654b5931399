I"Å<p><strong>I‚Äôm Neil</strong>. I live in Glasgow, Scotland and I work in the IT industry,
primarily in public sector outsourcing. I have a keen interest in <strong>networking</strong>
with a deep understanding of IP and higher-level protocols, <strong>systems
programming</strong> as well as <strong>infrastructure design</strong> at enterprise scale.</p>

<h2 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h2>

<p>My programming language of choice at the moment is <strong>Go</strong>, although I do also
have experience with <strong>C</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>. I have substantial working experience with <strong>Bash</strong> and <strong>PowerShell</strong> scripting languages, as well as
<strong>Lua</strong> in an application-embedded context.</p>

<p><strong>yggdrasil</strong> (Contributor, <a href="https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io">Website</a>)</p>

<p>A cross-platform prototype of an end-to-end encrypted IPv6 overlay network,
written in Go. It implements a new and experimental compact routing scheme based
around a globally-agreed spanning tree.</p>

<p><strong>seaglass</strong> (Author, <a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass">GitHub</a>, <a href="seaglass.md">Details</a>)</p>

<p>A native Matrix client for macOS, written in Swift and using native Cocoa user
interface frameworks. Primarily powered by the Matrix iOS SDK.</p>

<p><strong>jnacl</strong> (Author, <a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/jnacl">GitHub</a>, <a href="jnacl.md">Details</a>)</p>

<p>Pure Java implementation of a number of NaCl elliptic curve primitives,
including the Curve25519 elliptic curve, Xsalsa20 stream cipher and Poly1305
message authentication algorithm.</p>

<p><strong>sigmavpn</strong> (Author, <a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/sigmavpn">GitHub</a>)</p>

<p>Incredibly lightweight point-to-point VPN solution for Linux and UNIX-based
systems, written in C, making use of elliptic curve cryptography. A purely
native Android port was also created.</p>

<h4 id="user-level-data-centre-tomography-acm-sigcomm-helsinki-finland">User-Level Data Centre Tomography (ACM SIGCOMM, Helsinki, Finland)</h4>

<p>Poster submission. Measurement and inference in data centres present a set of
opportunities and challenges distinct from the Internet domain. Existing
toolsets may be perturbed or be misled by issues related to virtualisation. Yet,
while equally confronted by scale, data centres are relatively homogenous and
symmetric. We believe these may be attributes to be exploited. However, data is
required to better evaluate our hypotheses.</p>

<p>Therefore, we introduce our efforts to gather data using a single framework from
which we can launch tests of our choosing. Our observations reinforce recent
claims, but indicate changes in the network. They also reveal additional
obfuscations stemming from virtualisation.</p>
