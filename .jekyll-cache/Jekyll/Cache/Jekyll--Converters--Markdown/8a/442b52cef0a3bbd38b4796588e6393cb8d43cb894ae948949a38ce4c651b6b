<p>jnacl is a library that implements some of Daniel J. Bernsteinâ€™s NaCl encryption
primitives. The functions are written in pure Java, and are therefore very
straight-forward to make use of in a Java application without the use of native
libraries and bindings.</p>

<p>The following primitives are included:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">curve25519</code>: Elliptic curve key agreement</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">salsa20</code>: Stream cipher</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">poly1305</code>: Message authenticator (MAC)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is open-source and <a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/jnacl">available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Even though it has not been comprehensively benchmarked, jnacl performs
exceptionally well, even on resource-constrained Android platforms.</p>
