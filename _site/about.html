<p>Poster submission. Measurement and inference in data centres present a set of
opportunities and challenges distinct from the Internet domain. Existing
toolsets may be perturbed or be misled by issues related to virtualisation. Yet,
while equally confronted by scale, data centres are relatively homogenous and
symmetric. We believe these may be attributes to be exploited. However, data is
required to better evaluate our hypotheses.</p>

<p>Therefore, we introduce our efforts to gather data using a single framework from
which we can launch tests of our choosing. Our observations reinforce recent
claims, but indicate changes in the network. They also reveal additional
obfuscations stemming from virtualisation.</p>
